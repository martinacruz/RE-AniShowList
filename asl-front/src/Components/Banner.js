A public decree banned citizens from playing any melodies, to prevent further casualties caused by the D2s' hatred for musicâ€”even now, in 2047, this prohibition is still in effect. Humanity's only form of defense against the D2s are Musicarts, young women representing pieces of classical music; and Conductors, the ones controlling them.</p>
